# L-System

A work in progress node module (my very first), that generates L-Systems including all features from Algorithmic Beauty of Plants.

# Scripts to get going

`npm run start`: Runs the parser on a variety of inputs, showing outputs
`npm run test`: Runs test with jest, parser only for now
`npm watch`: Runs typescript (tsc) in watch mode.
